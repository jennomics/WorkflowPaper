The left half of the figure shows a poorly constructed, or uninformative tree. The species in question (Tatumella sp) is located within a poorly defined clade which contains multiple species many of which are represented else where in the tree. The bootstrap value of the selected clade is high (0.933) indicating it is well supported by the data, however multiple species are placed inside and outside of the clade indicating some phylogenetic uncertainty. Budvicia aquatica was chosen as the outgroup because it is phylogenetically distinct in comparison with Tatumella.

The right half of the figure shows the BLAST results for the 16s SSU rRNA of our species. As in the tree, there is significant phylogenetic uncertainty for the unknown species.
