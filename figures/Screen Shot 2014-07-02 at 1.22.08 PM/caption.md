The left half of the figure shows an uninformative tree. The species in question (_Tatumella_ sp) is located within a poorly defined clade which contains multiple species some of which are represented elsewhere in the tree. The bootstrap value of the selected clade is high (0.933) indicating it is well supported by the data, however multiple species are placed inside and outside of the clade indicating some phylogenetic uncertainty. _Budvicia aquatica_ was chosen as the outgroup because it is phylogenetically distinct to _Tatumella_.

The right half of the figure shows the BLAST results for the 16s SSU rRNA of our species. As in the tree, there is significant phylogenetic uncertainty for the target species.
