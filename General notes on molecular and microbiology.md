#General notes on molecular and microbiology
This workflow assumes basic knowledge of molecular biology and sterile technique. The starting point is the collection of microbes from a surface with a swab. We will cover the steps necessary to take a sample through plating, dilution streaking, overnight growth, creating a glycerol stock, 16s rDNA PCR, and preparation for Sanger sequencing to determine the identity of your bacterial or archaeal isolate (WHY DOES THI HAVE TO BE BACTERIA? WHAT ABOUT ARCHAEA?).  

Throughout the "Isolation" section we refer to "agar" and "culture media". The choice of media will depend on the goals of the particular project. Some factors to consider when selecting media and conditions for growth include: 

1. What type of organism do you want to isolate?

2. Are there types of organisms (e.g., pathogens) that you would prefer not to isolate?  For example, swabbing people and growing samples on blood agar at \(37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) is probably not advised in most cases.
  

3. How much time is available for growth and isolation?
    + many bacteria will grow faster at higher temperatures, but at some point, a threshhold will be reached and many species won't grow
    + you will be able to isolate a greater diversity of organisms if you allow a long time for slow-growing things to grow
   
5. What types of equipment are available to you?

   + if something grows most happily at \(37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\), then you will need to have an incubator and shaker available at that temperature

 For our previous work we have simply used a rich media such as lysogeny broth (LB) and growth at either room temperature or \(37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\).
