#General notes on molecular and microbiology
This section assumes basic knowledge of molecular biology and sterile technique. The starting point for this workflow is the collection of microbes from a surface with a cotton swab. Here we cover the steps necessary to take a sample through plating, dilution streaking, overnight growth, creating a glycerol stock, 16s rDNA PCR, and preparation for Sanger sequencing to determine the identity of your bacterial isolate.  

Throughout this section we refer to "agar" and "culture media". The choice of media will depend on the goals of the particular project. Some factors to consider when selecting media and conditions for growth include: 

1. what type of organism do you want to isolate?

2. are there types of organisms (e.g., pathogens) that you would prefer not to isolate?
   tips for minimizing pathogen growth

3. how much time is available for growth and isolation?
4.    + things will grow faster at higher temperatures, but at some point, a threshhold will be reached and many will die
   + you will be able to isolate a greater diversity of organisms if you allow a long time for slow-growing things to grow
   
5. what types of equipment are available to you?

   + if something grows most happily at 37deg, then you will need to have an incubator and shaker available at that temperature

 For our previous work we have simply used a rich growth media such as lysogeny broth (LB) (REF)
